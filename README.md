# passgen-hw3
*Objectives*

For this project my goal was to succesfully write in JS for a password generator.

Some of the requirements were:
* new, secure password needs to be generated when I click generate a password  
* User will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    Password criteria follows:
    * length of the password of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    * Four character types of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters (user must choose one)
* a password that matches the selected criteria generates once user suffice password criteria
* the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

*Reflection*

The hardest part of this assignment was to understand how the flow of the JS worked.
I did psuedo code before I started writing the code but my understanding was that the generate password button had to be hit first to start creating the password. However, after much deliberation, that the user needed to clear all the criteria FIRST in order to proceed and hit the generate password.

Another challenge was to figure out how to quilt all of the functions we learned in class seamlessly to make this work.

I will practice JS more in my free time.
